jQuery Reel Test Suite
======================
A few **preliminary** tests. Can't call it a collection yet, but they already helped.
The suite will slowly grow as new tests will be added from time to time
independent on version releases.

Usage?
------------
Just run `index.html` in your own browser.

If you have a positive test in a browser not listed here, I would love to know about!

Positively tested
-----------------
All tests pass on following browsers and platforms:

* Safari 3+, Firefox 3+, Chrome, IE 5.5+
* MacOS, iPhoneOS, Windows, Ubuntu

On iPhone, besides these automated tests, there's also the *touch* part of the deal.
Browse `example/iphone.html` in your iPhone
or watch short **[test session video][iphone-test]**
