"Dancer" (will be 1.1)
----------------------
* Using standard jQuery's `.val()` facility one can set or get value representation of the fraction in the range defined by new `minimum` and `maximum` options (0 to 100 by default). Default initial value can be adjusted by using new `value` option.
* Support for multi-row object movies added by possibility to control Y axis too.
    * `rows` option sets the vertical rows count.
    * `row` the initial row on which to start.

* The `sensitivity` option has become obsolete and had been removed.
* Suggestive open/closed palm cursor used for mouse pointer.

* Downsizing of JPEG sprites due to dimensions limit on iPhone may now be surpassed by using the `images` option to load individual images.
* Prevented an accidental selection of the projector on iPhone.
* Decimal fraction is now used as a base for internal computations instead of using frames.

    * `step` option can be used to override initial `frame` option.
    * `revolution` option is a pixel distance mouse drag has to travel for full revolution.

    * `timeout` option is a period of user inactivity after which animation is resumed again.
* Also to control the animation from outside the reel, new events `"play"`, `"pause"` a≈Ñd `"stop"`.

Version 1.0.3
-------------
