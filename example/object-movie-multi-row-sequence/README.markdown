jQuery Reel Multi-Row Sequence Object Movie Example
===================================================

Example of a multi-row setup, which allows you to add additional pitch
angles, in which the complete horizontal "row" is available adding a
significant vertical resolution to the object. This example has 6 rows
each with 20 frames and starts on 14th frame on the 3rd row. It also is
animated with one revolution per ~3 seconds.

It also showcases (1) how to place annotations into certain rows and (2)
how to configure the frame-based positioning of an annotation.
