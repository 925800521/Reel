jQuery Reel Examples
====================

Reel has all the available examples centralized here in the `example/`
folder as of version 1.2. This means you will not find any examples in the
`test/` folder anymore. Everything moved here.

- Each subfolder represents a completely self-contained example, which can
eventually be taken out and re-used easiy with little or no modification.
Each example has all it needs inside that folder.
- Examples are nearly completely naked without any balast other than
stylesheet, example title and image credits.
- All examples link for jQuery 1.7 and latest Reel from respective CDNs.
