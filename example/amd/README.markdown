jQuery Reel AMD Compatibility
=============================

Reel is made compatible with two asynchronous module definitions standards
- [AMD][amd] and [CommonJS][commonjs]. This example demonstrates the first one,
which also has a dependency on jQuery defined for improved loading.


See the complete source of [index.html](index.html) for full
implementation.
