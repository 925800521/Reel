Reel is a jQuery plugin which takes an image tag and makes it 
a live "projection" of pre-built animation frames sequence. 
Its aim is to provide a 360Â° view of something or someplace. 
Great alternative to widely used Flash techniques.

* Intuitive operation. Supports mouse wheel!
* No need for a stitched image but we do support them too.
* Plays fair with your existing CSS.
* Browser and operating system agnostic. It's your choice.
* No browser extensions needed. No Flash, nothing. It's just an image...
* Tiny code base. No carbon footprint!
